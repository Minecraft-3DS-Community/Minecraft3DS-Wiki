    <h2>Multiple Game Instances</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have multiple versions of Minecraft from either other regions or a Game-Cart with a digital copy, these will interfere with Mods being loaded.</li>
      <li>You should only have one version of the game on your system at a time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DLC/Update + Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a region-free game or DLC/update and a USA/EUR/JPN copy of Minecraft 3DS, they can cause mods to not work fully or at all.</li>
      <li>Ensure everything matches the same region, and nothing is mismatched.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>LCL</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure Luma Chain Loader has "Game Patching" enabled.</li>
      <li>Hold Select at startup to access the menu. If the option doesn't show a <code>[X]</code> on "Game Patching," enable it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Download Mods for Your Game's Region</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure you're installing mods to the correct game version to avoid issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conflicting Mods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Some mods like <code>Skyblock+ (Plus)</code> and <code>Amplified World Generation</code> cannot be installed together.</li>
      <li>Check for conflicts by contacting the creator on Discord.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Version</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nearly all mods for Minecraft 3DS were made for patch <code>v1.9.19</code>.</li>
      <li>Ensure your game is fully updated with the correct region update/DLC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Incorrectly Made Mods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Some mods are buggy or outdated. Test with another mod to verify the issue.</li>
      <li>Contact the creator of the problematic mod for support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mods Not Installing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If mods aren't installing from the UniStore, try reinstalling the UniStore itself.</li>
      <li>Delete the UniStore via the Universal Updater settings and reinstall it using the QR code from this 
        <a href="https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/minecraft-3ds-unistore" target="_blank">link</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
