    <h1>Modding *.bjson Files</h1>
    <p>
      <code>*.bjson</code> Files contain a lot about the game, including how fonts, textures, and models are rendered and displayed. In today's guide, we will go over two ways to mod/edit these files, one of which is extremely experimental but much easier than traditional means.
    </p>

    <h2>Manually Editing the File</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Before reading this section, please read up about it in <code>&lt;#1235023744280563792&gt;</code>. It has free documentation on the file format itself and how it operates compared to traditional <code>*.json</code> files.</li>
      <li>You will need a hex editor like <code>ImHex</code> or <code>HxD</code> (my personal favorite).</li>
      <li>Since there is a lot of stuff to understand and yet to be learned from this format, we highly recommend STBrian/STBUniverse's <a href="https://github.com/STBrian/MC3DS-BJSON-Editor/releases/latest" target="_blank">MC3DS-BJSON-Editor</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using *.bjson Editor</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the *.bjson Editor from the link here: <a href="https://github.com/STBrian/MC3DS-BJSON-Editor/releases/latest" target="_blank">*.bjson Editor</a>.</li>
      <li>Windows Defender might say the file is a Trojan/Virus. It isn't malware and is fully open-source.</li>
      <li>After dealing with Windows Defender, start the application up and navigate to: <code>File > Open</code> in the context menu, and load your <code>*.bjson</code> file.</li>
      <li>If you're looking to modify geometry, you'll need to look for "Cube, Pivot, and Rotation" objects, and also texture width and heights.</li>
    </ol>
